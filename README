Some of the goals of this project are to develop a bot which learns from a specified area of input and have it
generate output on that specific input

Modular
  -Have different learning algorithms which can be used
  -Have different ways of accepting input: text file, stdin, IRC, html
  -Have different ways of displaying output: text file, stdin, IRC, web forms

Cross Platform
  -Must be able to compile and run on at least Windows and Linux (I do not own a Mac to develop on unfortunately)



To build (TO DO):

Windows:

Linux:
