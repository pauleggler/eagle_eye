Instead of starting from scratch I decided to fork the Seeborg repository
from google code.  I'm new at this so if I forgot any license related
stuff or not giving proper credit please let me know.

Seeborg on google code:  http://code.google.com/p/seeborg/

Some of the goals of this project are to develop a bot which learns from a specified area of input and have it generate output on that specific input

Modular
  -Have different learning algorithms which can be used
  -Have different ways of accepting input: text file, stdin, IRC, html
  -Have different ways of displaying output: text file, stdin, IRC, web forms

Cross Platform
  -Must be able to compile and run on at least Windows and Linux (I do not own a Mac to develop on unfortunately)
